# PolyPIV
Particle Image Velocimetry software developed for my undergraduate thesis.

This award-winning software requires the following external libraries:
-FFTW for computing the discrete Fourier transform.
-FreeImage for saving images in several formats.
-GTK+ for managing the Graphic User Interface.

The GUI description was made on the GLADE software.

The development and testing environment included:
- Debian linux 7
- gcc version 5
